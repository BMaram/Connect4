# Connect4Java
This project provides an online multi-player game on single server using threads in java by using Socket and ServerSocket classes communicating by CFP (Connect Four protocol) as shown below FIG1 , with graphical interface on client side using Swing and the NetBeans IDE.

### What is Connect four ?
Connect Four is a two-playe connection game in which the players first take
turns dropping one colored disc from the top into an eight-column, six-row
vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest
available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to
form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

### Implementation
Client uses Graphical User Interface (GUI) programming with Swing and the NetBeans IDE. Uses CFP(connect four protocol) for client/server connection. Threaded to allow multiple clients to play concurrently on a single server.

### This project can be modified to support other games.
